#Defining an Extension

The fiber script will look scan a directory to check if it contains an extension.json file.If one is found then the directory is registered as an extension.

```json
  {
    "name":"myextension",
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "description":"This is an extension to show how to set one up",
    "main":"main.js",
    "consumes":["a","b"]
  }
```
